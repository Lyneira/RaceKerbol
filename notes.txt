= Sun exposure thresholds =
These are the thresholds for different states of the solar racer based on sun
exposure on a level surface. Sun exposure may be higher when going downhill,
lower when maintaining flight or going uphill, but atmospheric attenuation also
has a great effect here when the sun starts to set.

For states less than full power, a small margin allowing for maneuvering and
hilly terrain is taken into account. (at least -0.5 on the ElectricCharge meter)

Timestamps for the exposure states were experimentally recorded with a non-moving racer.
